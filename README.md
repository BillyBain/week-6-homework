## week-6-homework

This week I was tasked with making a weather application.
The purpose of this of this task is to use an api, specifically https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api.
This is a free api that allows you to pull data about the weather.

This task was a lot of fun. The part that was the most difficult at first was learning to navigate the pulled response.
Once I mastered that I used it to grab various elements like tempature, conditions, and wind speed.
I also set up a five day forecast and icons to show all the conditions.
The icon for the UV Index is set up to change colors depending on the severity. 
Green of ideal, Yellow for moderate, and Red for severe.

When you type in any city the results will display. The city will also be added to a search history as a button.
When clicked it will redisplay the results.
